Three
things
to
remember:
June 2012

I
'm
running
Windows 7
64-bit
and
I
had
the
32-bit
JRE
installed
.
I
downloaded
Eclipse
64-bit
which
looks
for
a
64-bit
JRE
.
Because
I
did
n't
have
the
64-bit
JRE
it
threw
the
error
,
which

sense
.
They
are
independent
languages
with
unrelated
lineages.
Brendan Eich
created
Javascript
originally
at
Netscape.
It
was
initially
called
Mocha.

of
Javascript
as
a
name
was
a

you
will
,
to
the
then
ascendant
Java
programming
language
,
developed
at
Sun
by
Patrick Naughton
,
James Gosling
,
et.

.
What

the
difference
between
JavaScript
and
Java
?
Java
and
Javascript
are
similar
like
Car
and
Carpet
are
similar
.
One
is
essentially
a
toy
,
designed
for
writing
small
pieces
of
code
,
and
traditionally
used
and
abused
by
inexperienced
programmers
.
The
other
is
a
scripting
language
for
web
browsers
.
Here
are
some
differences
between
the
two
languages:
Here
are
some
features
that
I
think
are
particular
strengths
of
