JavaScript
is
an
object-oriented
scripting
language
that
allows
you
to
create
dynamic
HTML pages
,
allowing
you
to
process
input
data
and
maintain
data
,
usually
within
the
browser
.
Brendan Eich
created
Javascript
originally
at
Netscape
.
The
choice
of
Javascript
as
a
name
was
a
nod
,
if
you
will
,
to
the
then
ascendant
Java
programming
language
,
developed
at
Sun
by
Patrick Naughton
,
James Gosling
,
et
.
Java
was
created
at
Sun
Microsystems
now
Oracle
.
language
for
standardization
to
ECMA European Computer Manufacturer's Association
Practically
every
PC
in
the
world
sells
with
at
least
one
JavaScript
interpreter
installed
on
it
.
Most
but
not
``
practically
all
''
PCs
have
a
Java VM
installed
.
Place
the
file
in
directory
structure
matching
your
package
name
after
extracting
.jar
file
,
it
should
be
in
the
same
directory
as
.class
file
,
then
access
it
using
getClass
.getResourceAsStream
``
file.txt
''
Place
the
file
at
the
root
after
extracting
.jar
file
,
it
should
be
in
the
root
,
then
access
it
using
Thread.currentThread
.getContextClassLoader
.getResourceAsStream
``
file.txt
''
Basically
first
way
work
within
.jar
file
and
second
way
works
within
eclipse
or
other
IDE
.
For
example
,
if
the
Servlet
shown
above
authenticates
the
user
,
I
'd
like
to
print
the
user
id
in
my
HTML page
.
I
should
be
able
to
send
the
string
'id
'
as
a
response
and
use
this
info
in
my
HTML page
.

You
should
use
doGet
when
you
want
to
intercept
on
HTTP GET requests
.
You
should
use
doPost
when
you
want
to
intercept
on
HTTP POST requests
.
Usually
,
HTTP GET requests
are
idempotent
.
Clicking
a
link
,
clicking
a
bookmark
,
entering
raw
URL
in
browser
address
bar
,
etcetera
will
all
fire
a
HTTP GET request
.
HTTP POST requests
are
not
idempotent
.
If
the
enduser
has
submitted
a
POST form
on
an
URL
beforehand
,
which
has
n't
performed
a
redirect
,
then
the
URL
is
not
necessarily
bookmarkable
.
gathering
data
from
a
submitted
HTML form
and
doing
some
business
stuff
with
it
conversion
,
validation
,
saving
in
DB
,
etcetera
.
Finally
usually
the
result
is
presented
as
HTML form
the
forwarded
JSP page
.

That
said
,
I
am
not
sure
if
it
is
just
playing
around
and
shooting
in
the
dark
,
but
the
code
which
you
posted
does
n't
look
good
such
as
using
compareTo
Iinstead
of
equals
and
digging
in
the
parameternames
instead
of
just
using
getParameter
and
the
id
and
password
seems
to
be
declared
as
servlet instance variables
which
is
NOT
threadsafe
.
So
I
would
strongly
recommend
to
learn
a
bit
more
about
basic
Java SE API
using
the
Oracle
tutorials
check
the
chapter
``
Trails
Covering
the
Basics
''
and
how
to
use
JSP/Servlets
the
right
way
using
those
tutorials
.

I
am
trying

get
Eclipse v3.5

I
have

I
keep
getting
this

I
'm
running
Windows 7 64-bit
and
I
had
the
32-bit JRE
installed
.
I
downloaded
Eclipse 64-bit
which
looks
for
a
64-bit JRE
.
Because
I
did
n't
have
the
64-bit JRE
it
threw
the
error
,
which
makes
sense
.
